#+TITLE: DragonReign, a guix home configuration

DragonReign is an attempt to recreate my home environment with guix.
This is done for a bunch of reasons:
- Stability :: even though I don't change my config files a lot having a way to rollback changes is quite useful
- Reproducibility :: I own two laptop, a infinitybook pro 14 by Tuxedo and a PineBook Pro, even though they are quite different
  in hardware I'd like to be able to have the same environment (with few exception) on both
